About seven months ago I had published [the first issue](https://metaframe.works/archive/0/) of my first newsletter â€” Metaframeworks Weekly, dedicated to JavaScript-based tools like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Astro and their place in the modern web development. Today I'm renaming it to [Metaframeworks Records](https://metaframe.works) and sharing some why's, pains, and gains here, following up [the initial post](https://fyodor.io/let-s-talk-metaframeworks/) from the last days of the last year.

## Lesson 1: Roll up your sleeves

## Lesson 2: Form the shape as you go

## Lesson 3: Simplicity is great until it's not

### Astro is cool

### Buttondown is awesome

### Bluesky is lovely

## Lesson 4: Security is important, from back to front

## Lesson 5: It only starts here
