* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fyodorio/) — I'm there for meaningful work-related connections mostly, don't like the vanity fair part though
* [Mastodon](https://qoto.org/@fyodorio) — trying to get a glimpse of it yet
* [Twitter/X](https://x.com/fyodorio) — I loved that, but I don't like what it becomes at all, so a rare guest  
* [GitHub](https://github.com/fyodorio) — my public code is there mostly
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fyodorio) — some early CSS experiments, use as a minimalist sandbox here and there

* [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@fyodorio) — my second reading source
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/fyodorio/) — some interesting search results lead there very often, it's hard to ignore

* [Discord](https://discord.com) — my username there is `.fyodorio`, if you'd like to connect (not a frequent guest, but hangout here and there — some awesome communities reside on Discord exclusively)
