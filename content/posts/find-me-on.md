Welcome to my links page! Here you can find all the resources where you can connect with [me](/about).

* [Email](mailto:ping@fyodor.io) — I ❤️ emails the most!
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fyodorio/) — I'm there for meaningful work-related connections mostly, don't like the vanity fair part though
* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/fyodor.io) (rarely, and even less often [Mastodon](https://qoto.org/@fyodorio)) — for some minimal social interactions (I used to [browse Twitter/X](https://x.com/fyodorio) but I fail to accept what it is now)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/fyodorio) — my public code is there mostly but I consider and test self-hosted alternatives _slowly_
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fyodorio) — some old CSS experiments, use as a minimalist sandbox here and there
* [DEV](https://dev.to/fyodorio) — my main source of reading these days; I also repost some stuff there, and write some original texts too, for dedicated discussions mostly (I don't read [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@fyodorio) anymore, it's too bland these days)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/fyodorio/) — some interesting search results lead there very often, it's hard to ignore
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6778546/fyodor) — _that_ website... you know...
* [Discord](https://discord.com) — my username there is `.fyodorio`, if you'd like to connect (not a frequent guest though, IMO it's just not the right place for meaningful discussions)
