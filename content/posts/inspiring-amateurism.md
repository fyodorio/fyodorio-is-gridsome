I listen to a lot of programming-related podcasts, that's one of the ways I both educate myself with some occasional technology aspects on the background, and keep myself acquainted with the latest and the greatest in the software development world (not much, TBH). I have a curated list of podcast episodes I get to when I'm doing chores usually, or woodworking, or dogwalking, or whatnot. Sometimes it's new stuff from shows I follow, sometimes it's something I found during targeted search about some technology I'm currently interested in.

One of my favourite tech shows of all time is ["Software Unscripted"](https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/software-unscripted) — always thoughtful and long no-bullshit conversations about different aspects of computer science, programming languages, and a lot more from the host who's themself is a great person and educator — [Richard Feldman](https://github.com/rtfeldman) (I love their [courses on FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/richard-feldman/) so much too, the cleverest and the most modest teacher on the interwebs!).

There was this guy on the show once (quite some time ago, found this episode accidentally), Casey Muratori, who's an expert in software performance selling their courses and other educational materials and considering themself proficient in different technologies including web development. And when Richard started to talk about ORMs with them, Casey accepted they hear this term first time in their life and was really surprised people do that shit to SQL...

Another show I love is ["Rust in production"](https://corrode.dev/podcast/), where [Matthias Endler](https://github.com/mre) speaks to seasoned Rust developers about their experience in building future-proof production software systems. There was an episode recently with Andrew Burkhart, Senior Rust Engineer at 1password. This episode was even too exciting in terms of the clear "fake it til you make it" philosophy of the guest. When you think about all those Rust system engineers developing low-level software in their mind in assembly and then translating it on the fly to some formal language you, a poor web developer, can only have nightmares about, you imagine some Yoda-level gurus (and don't get me wrong, they often are). But as a matter of fact, usually these people have no idea what they are doing at the beginning and learn on the fly (at best!), growing their craftsmen wings in process (or pretending they do).

What it taught me is some calmness for my inner critic and impostor alter-ego: if the guys we all are admired by too often have no idea what they do on a professional level they're paid for and still are considered to be the experts, I think we all, usual software developers from the darkest corners of the software world, have a chance to some day say to ourselves, "well done, boy!"

I mean, we all constantly hear and see these memes and shitposts in social media about "hey, I'm a seasoned software developer and today I asked ChatGPT how to center a div", or "programmer's mind is constantly fluctuating between 'I am a God!' and 'I have no idea what I am doing'" but usually that's some self-deprecating bullshit, or a habitual well-known joke for likes of programming proles. But in fact, many people in software world pave their way to success through lots of empty stares at the dark screen blank brain over some simple programming task.

It's possible to be a know-it-all. It's just that usually we are not in a position to. There are some other things to do too. So it's fair to take it easy, slow down the pace, and give yourself some friendly pat on the shoulder and say "it's OK, you'll learn the borrow checker tomorrow, today you can just watch Netflix with the kid... or play you some harpsichord... like those guy from Rust in Production podcast... like the PRO..."
