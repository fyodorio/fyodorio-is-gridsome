My interest in [full-stack hybrid rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering) and the corresponding tools was sparked by [Rich Harris‚Äô talk at Jamstack Conf 2021 titled ‚ÄúTransitional Apps‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o) (you can find the transcription [here](https://geoffrich.net/posts/rich-harris-jamstack-conf-2021/), thanks to Geoff Rich). At the time, I was in the middle of my personal JavaScript fatigue (and SPA fatigue) escalation, and the ideas expressed by Rich resonated deeply with me. There wasn‚Äôt a sticky name for this approach yet, so ‚Äútransitional apps‚Äù was a kind of first attempt at naming it.

Several years later, this idea is ubiquitous and is more or less consistently called **‚Äúmetaframeworks.‚Äù**

As the name implies, _a metaframework_ is something that‚Äôs built on top of a framework, yet it also represents the intrinsic essence underlying the conventional framework entity. Yes, I see you yawning already. Practically, it‚Äôs a set of tools that complement a UI framework (like React, Angular, Vue, or whatnot) with server-side functionality and deployment adapters. Sometimes, there are many more features included, but that‚Äôs the gist of it.

There are lots of tools in this category, and I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve heard of them ‚Äî if not used them already (or on a day-to-day basis, like myself).

There are also lots of opinions about them, with complexity and developer experience often sitting on opposite sides of the scale. The only objective truth is that metaframeworks are something we need to live with, whether we want to or not, and they are, in most cases, a great example of good engineering, with many open-source contributors participating.

What I personally love about the metaframework movement and its rise in popularity is the emphasis on progressive enhancement and the flexibility that new technologies bring, including the possibilities of building your own bespoke systems using battle-tested tools and templates.

I want to dig deeper into this whole metaframeworks story, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to humbly share with you two things I‚Äôve just started to give myself a good kick into 2025.

The first is the open-source [Encyclopedia of Metaframeworks](https://github.com/fyodorio/awesome-metaframeworks) in the form of an awesome-list, familiar to everyone. I‚Äôve gathered the tools and links accumulated in my closet throughout the years, and I invite you to check it out and [join the ride](https://github.com/fyodorio/awesome-metaframeworks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The second is [the Metaframeworks Records newsletter](https://metaframe.works). This will be a regular, focused dive into the world of metaframeworks and the ecosystem around them ‚Äî tools, news, releases, people, and so on. You‚Äôll hardly find pompous odes to metaframeworks there; rather, you‚Äôll find an unbiased view of the topic and objective, multifaceted opinions.

All in all, I hope some of these resources might be of use to you, and maybe you‚Äôll even be willing to contribute to them ‚Äî whether by providing insightful submissions for the encyclopedia or by dropping me interesting relevant findings from around the web via [email](mailto:ping@fyodor.io).

With that, remember that the truth is always somewhere in the middle, and it tastes not like shiny Twitter influencer tarts but rather like your home-cooked, granny-recipe cakes.

Happy new year üéÑ
