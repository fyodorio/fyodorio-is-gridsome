Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fyodor.

I call myself _a software craftsman_. And this site is my _[digital shed](https://fyodor.io/turning-my-abandoned-blog-into-a-digital-shed/)_ (aka _digital garden_, but I'm not into plants). I aspire to be a full-stack developer but mostly do front-end work these days. My main area of interest is developer tools, and currently I help to build one of the greatest DevSecOps ecosystems around with other awesome folks at [42Crunch](https://42crunch.com/).

<details>

<summary>TL;DR: I have a long boring history of life and craft experiences behind, so if you're not into it, feel free to just pass by. But if you are...</summary>

I started to learn programming in primary school. I was fascinated with computers though I got my first personal one only when I went to university.

It were the years of floppy discs, mostly 3Â½-inch. My high school teacher used punch cards for her class notes and our test assignments.

My main motivation first was the communication with the computers. Then later, when I got deeper into maths and physics, the challenges, and problem solving were keeping my blood burning.

As I mentioned already, I didn't have a machine to practice programming at, so I did that only in classes, or on a paper sheet at home. Probably this enigmatic format of learning allowed me to do things that were boring for others and win school programming competitions for high-schoolers when I went to middle school yet.

The languages were Basic and Turbo Pascal, of course. The first was a magic creature. The second was a powerful beast. I never did something really cool with them, as I see it now, but I solved numerous puzzles and applied mathematical tests.

So I never had a doubt about what kind of degree should I pursue. But destiny shifted my way from CS to the dark side of more hardcode engineering. But on this wrong (as I understood later) road I meet with my old passion very often: CS course, applied programming and scripting for 3D modelling, macros for spreadsheet data processing, hobbyist websites, and so on.

When the number of times a day I nostalgically thought about programming at my job became too high, I decided to come back to this guilty please of mine.

I started part-time freelancing and occasional side hassles. And fell deeper and deeper in love with software development and GUI part of it.

At some point I said to myself it worth the risk and changed my civil engineering career to software engineering. And never looked back.

Long story short, I was always (and I am now, and I hope I will be) constantly building something and constantly learning something, and I like both processes very much.

This shed is the best place to find out everything I'm engaged with currently, but if you need some more networking and interactions, don't hesitate to ping me via email ([alinetofyodor@gmail.com](mailto:alinetofyodor@gmail.com)) or Twitters ([@fyodorio](https://twitter.com/fyodorio)). I hangout at some Discord servers periodically so maybe we're digital neighbours ðŸ˜‰
