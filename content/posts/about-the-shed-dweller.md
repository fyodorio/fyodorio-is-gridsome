Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fyodor.

I call myself _a software craftsman_. And this site is my _[digital shed](https://fyodor.io/turning-my-abandoned-blog-into-a-digital-shed/)_ (aka _digital garden_, but I'm not into plants). I aspire to be a full-stack developer but mostly do front-end work these days. My main area of interest is developer tools, and currently I help to build one of the greatest DevSecOps ecosystems around with other awesome folks at [42Crunch](https://42crunch.com/).

<details>

<summary>TL;DR: I have a long boring history of life and craft experiences behind, so if you're not into it, feel free to just pass by. But if you are...</summary>

TBD...

</details>

Long story short, I was always (and I am now, and I hope I will be) constantly building something and constantly learning something, and I like both processes very much.

This shed is the best place to find out everything I'm engaged with currently, but if you need some more networking and interactions, don't hesitate to ping me via email ([alinetofyodor@gmail.com](mailto:alinetofyodor@gmail.com)) or Twitters ([@fyodorio](https://twitter.com/fyodorio)). I hangout at some Discord servers periodically so maybe we're digital neighbours ðŸ˜‰
