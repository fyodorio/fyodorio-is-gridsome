Having worked in the industry for years, I often thought about why I'm on the same page with some people and never can find a common ground with another bunch. And it doesn't depend on professionalism (which is crucial though), or experience (sometimes beginner engineers are capable of outstanding thoughts and decisions), or sense of humor (well, at least not directly), or any other emotional aspects of interpersonal relationships (friendships on a job are often too brittle). What gets peers together, at least in my opinion, after peering with dozens of colleagues from all over the world, is their view of the results of their work.

In short, one cohort sees a _final product_ as the North Star or their journey, and another one sees their _service in itself_ as the main goal of their working life activities.

While putting stamps is not correct here, _in most cases_ these patterns or work behaviour define everything: starting from day-to-day experiences in teams, and finishing with resulting output(s), both in short terms, and in a long run.
