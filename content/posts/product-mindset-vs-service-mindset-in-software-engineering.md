Having worked in the industry for years, I often thought about why I'm on the same page with some people and never can find a common ground with another bunch. And it doesn't depend on professionalism (which is crucial though), or experience (sometimes beginner engineers are capable of outstanding thoughts and decisions), or sense of humor (well, at least not directly), or any other emotional aspects of interpersonal relationships (friendships on a job are often too brittle). What gets peers together, at least in my opinion, after peering with dozens of colleagues from all over the world, is their view of the results of their work.

In short, one cohort sees a _final product_ as the North Star or their journey, and another one sees their _service in itself_ as the main goal of their working life activities.

While putting stamps is not correct here, _in most cases_ these patterns or work behaviour define everything: starting from day-to-day experiences in teams, and finishing with resulting output(s), both in short terms, and in a long run.

Why my dachshund would be a good product engineer? Because she has the product mindset, where the product (no matter how cynical it sounds) is me. You can teach those who are _able to be loyal and believe in the goal_ how to build things. You cannot teach those who are _able to build things_ to be loyal and believe in the goal. And it, in practice, crashes even solid projects.

Why enterprise development sucks fun out of programming? Because it turns people from product-minded to service-minded, destroyng any potential loyalty and goal-orientation. It turns people to golden-handcuffed 9-to-5 checkbox traversers instead of software craftsmen.

Why most developer advocates, devrels, product evangelists and other software missioners sound so hypocritical to the folks at the plow? Because you see them jumping jobs so often, you start to confuse products they evangelize. Salesmen are much more honest in this regard. I truly think the only sincere advocate for a product is the founder of it, or a person attributing themselves to this role.

Why empathetic developers feel it so hard to survive in the software development industry? Because service mindset of the most of the peers makes it hard to cope with the way product teams work in 90% of the situations. While the emphaty to the child of your working efforts, the software you build, is usually suppressed as an atavism.
