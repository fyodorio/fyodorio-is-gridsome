I would like to dispel a myth prevailing among web developers, especially the younger ones, and those who didn't work with the hero of occasion to be familiar enough with it. The myth about monstrosity of the [Angular](https://angular.io) framework.

I want to indicate from the very beginning that I'm neither an interested party here nor opinionated Angular fan. It's not my favourite web or [front-end framework](https://fyodor.io/marvelous-frameworks/) (confession: I'm in love with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)). Moreover, I'm a big fan of [frameworkless movement](http://frameworklessmovement.org). But as soon as many of us (including myself) work in teams and need to use common toolsets, a framework is usually a part of our work day. 

The fear of Angular starts with confusion about its versions: Google made a bunch of [strange decisions](http://blog.angularjs.org/2016/09/angular2-final.html) when they were releasing Angular v.2 and leaving Angular(JS) 1.x live its own life. We can just cope with it. Nevertheless, today [the Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)) is just Angular and we're gonna talk here only about Angular 2+ version family.

* Angular way - all tools included
    * But modular and tree-shakeable, so you can go a minimalist way
* Learning curve
* TypeScript
    * No specific syntax like JSX ofr TSX
    * Type safety even in templates (>9)
* RxJS
* Separation of concerns 
    * Templates, stylesheets and business logic are in different files in most cases
    * Clear separation of components, template directive, services and utilities by purposes
* Lazy loading
    * By routes
    * By components/features (>9)
* Angular CLI and schematics
    * Help a lot in making things right
* Good architectural patterns
* Angular application development market is great for passionate problem solvers
* Best security approaches
* Great implementation of dynamic forms
* Great animations abstraction
* Coding best practices
* Great for team work
    * Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. (Leo Tolstoy)
    * Angular developers are all alike; every React/Vue developer is a developer in its own way.
* Great helpful community
* Final thought “The trouble about man is twofold. He cannot learn truths which are too complicated; he forgets truths which are too simple.” ― Rebecca West
    * Software development is not easy actually, but Angular covers it all. Learn it and you're dangerous already.
