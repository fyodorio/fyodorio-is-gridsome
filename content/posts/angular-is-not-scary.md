* My being non-opinionated due to having another framework as favourite
    * Mention my frameworks post
* Angular history
    * Angular v.1
    * Angular v.2
    * Angular v.9
* Angular way - all tools included
    * But modular and tree-shakeable, so you can go a minimalist way
* Learning curve
* TypeScript
    * No specific syntax like JSX ofr TSX
    * Type safety even in templates (>9)
* RxJS
* Separation of concerns 
    * Templates, stylesheets and business logic are in different files in most cases
    * Clear separation of components, template directive, services and utilities by purposes
* Lazy loading
    * By routes
    * By components/features (>9)
* Angular CLI and schematics
    * Help a lot in making things right
* Good architectural patterns
* Best security approaches
* Great implementation of dynamic forms
* Great animations abstraction
* Coding best practices
* Great for team work
    * Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. (Leo Tolstoy)
    * Angular developers are all alike; every React/Vue developer is a developer in its own way.
* Great helpful community
* Final thought “The trouble about man is twofold. He cannot learn truths which are too complicated; he forgets truths which are too simple.” ― Rebecca West
    * Software development is not easy actually, but Angular covers it all. Learn it and you're dangerous already.
