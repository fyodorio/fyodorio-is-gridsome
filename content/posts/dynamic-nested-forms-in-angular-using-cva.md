Someone said that modern web apps are basically just forms and lists. If lists are easy to grasp for any software craftsman, forms can be tough, especially if you work with some web-development framework and its opinionated patterns and tools. 

## Problem
 
## Case Study

## Options

There are several well-tested solutions providing out-of-the-box functionality for creating dynamic forms, like
 [formly](https://formly.dev/), or [ngx-sub-forms](https://dev.to/maxime1992/building-scalable-robust-and-type-safe-forms-with-angular-3nf9), or [ng-dynamic-forms](https://github.com/udos86/ng-dynamic-forms). Though if you need some simple "native" dependency-free way of creating dynamic forms, you can go with Angular's internal tools like [`ReactiveFormsModule`](https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule) and [`ControlValueAccessor`](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor) structure which acts as a bridge between the Angular forms API and a native element in the DOM.
 
 So here we are going to take a look at a simple (though scalable) solution that can be used as a good start for implementing dynamic forms in the Angular application without any 3rd-party libraries.
