> This is the *second* part of the series describing the way [Angular](https://angular.io) deals with dynamic and nested reactive forms 

Angular, as a component-based frameworks, embraces maximum component decomposition. Form components are no exception. As a form-containing component grows bigger, the necessity to decompose it to a set of (potentially reusable) child components emerges. 

Creating a child component and [passing a form control to it](https://blog.grossman.io/real-world-angular-reactive-forms/) as an input looks as an answer at first sight. However, we'll se that Angular provides a more convenient, efficient and scalable one. We'll have a glance at ready-made go-to solutions and implement a custom one to get understanding of how Angular's Reactive Forms work in this regard.

## Prerequisites

Though I try to explain the topic of nested form components here in a simple and concise way, this is a kind of advanced tutorial. I highly recommend the prerequisites from [the first part](https://fyodor.io/dynamic-forms-in-angular/) of this series here, as well as having the first part read prior to this one to get more context on the case study and dynamic forms approach in general.

## Case Study

## Options

There are several well-tested solutions providing out-of-the-box functionality for creating dynamic nested forms, like
 [formly](https://formly.dev/), or [ngx-sub-forms](https://dev.to/maxime1992/building-scalable-robust-and-type-safe-forms-with-angular-3nf9), or [ng-dynamic-forms](https://github.com/udos86/ng-dynamic-forms). Though if you need some simple "native" dependency-free way of creating dynamic forms, you can go with Angular's internal tools like [`ReactiveFormsModule`](https://angular.io/api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule) and [`ControlValueAccessor`](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor) structure which acts as a bridge between the Angular forms API and a native element in the DOM.
 
 So here we are going to take a look at a simple (though scalable) solution that can be used as a good start for implementing dynamic forms in the Angular application without any 3rd-party libraries.
