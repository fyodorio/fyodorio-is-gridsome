I love [The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)) and [The Lord Of The Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)). The [Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s Middle-earth universe is such an awesome place to be, at least in dreams. There's so much inspiration in all the characters inhabiting it. And so much to learn from: courage, responsibility, curiosity, trust, friendship, whatnot. But today I'm going to draw a slightly comic analogy between some movie episodes and ways one can learn programming. Many a true word is spoken in jest, so lets take a look at learning processes from a different angle and see, which one is more suitable for each of us.  

## Self Teaching
