I like listening to podcasts when I do something that allows for that (no time to make it in a more focused way unfortunately). For years I had gathered my own favourites and opinions on that. My own list of shows changed several times but what remained is a solid set of podcasts about different sides of technology (mostly webdev but there's something more). Some shows vanished with time but the legacy of them is so good I re-listen chosen episodes when I feel nostalgic, so I had added them in the end as well.

I tried to add example episodes for each of the show in the list to give a good feeling of what is that about and why it can be interesting for someone else. But again, that's just another opinion in the Internet (and mine may be harsh sometimes) so take it with a grain of salt.

And last but not least, that's not a rating, sometimes some shows that can be considered boring make good surprises, and vice versa. So none of them is too much better than the other.
