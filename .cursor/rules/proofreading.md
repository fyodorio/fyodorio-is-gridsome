# Proofreading Rules

This file defines proofreading standards for editing and correcting text in the digital shed.

## English Style

- Use British style English and typography rules
- Use American spelling for words like "color" (not "colour") and "-ize" verbs (e.g., "organize" not "organise")
- Use sentence case for titles - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns
- Use en-dashes wrapped in spaces (` â€“ `) instead of em-dashes

## Sentence Structure

- Long sentences are acceptable and often preferred for nuanced thoughts
- Don't enforce active voice when passive voice is used intentionally
- Maintain consistent voice (active/passive) within the same section
- Ensure consistent verb tense within sentences and paragraphs

## Word Choice

- Prefer simple words over complex ones (e.g., "use" instead of "utilize")
- Use casual, informal tone appropriate for a technical newsletter
- Use "they/them/their" as neutral pronouns rather than "he/she" constructions
- Use straight apostrophes (`'`), not curly apostrophes

## Punctuation & Formatting

- Use the Oxford comma (serial comma) in lists of three or more items
- Use consistent spacing around punctuation
- Don't correct quotes or text within markdown quote blocks (`>`)
- Always write "metaframework" and "metaframeworks" without hyphens

## Correction Approach

- Preserve the original text as much as possible
- Flag incorrect usage of idioms or phrases, but provide explicit alternatives
- Maintain the author's original voice and style
- Point out inconsistencies in tense, voice, or terminology
